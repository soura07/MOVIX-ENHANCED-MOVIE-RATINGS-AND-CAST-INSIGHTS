<h3>üôè Acknowledgments</h3>

In the development of Movix, we express our gratitude to the following third-party libraries and APIs that have significantly contributed to the application's functionality and user experience:

- **Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`):** A comprehensive toolset for managing application state with Redux, streamlining state management and reducing boilerplate code.

- **Axios (`axios`):** A reliable and efficient HTTP client that seamlessly integrates with the TMDB API, enabling smooth data retrieval.

- **Day.js (`dayjs`):** A lightweight and versatile library for date and time manipulation, enhancing the application's date formatting capabilities.

- **React (`react`) and React DOM (`react-dom`):** The core libraries powering the dynamic user interface and rendering of React components.

- **React Circular Progressbar (`react-circular-progressbar`):** An eye-catching component that brings visually appealing circular progress bars to the application.

- **React Icons (`react-icons`):** A treasure trove of icons that adds visual charm and enhances the user interface with diverse iconography.

- **React Infinite Scroll Component (`react-infinite-scroll-component`):** Empowers infinite scrolling functionality, making content loading seamless and intuitive.

- **React Lazy Load Image Component (`react-lazy-load-image-component`):** Enhances performance by deferring image loading until needed, improving page loading times.

- **React Player (`react-player`):** Facilitates smooth integration of media players to showcase movie trailers and videos within the application.

- **React Redux (`react-redux`):** Seamlessly integrates Redux state management with React, providing predictable application state handling.

- **React Router DOM (`react-router-dom`):** Enables smooth and intuitive navigation and routing within the application.

- **React Select (`react-select`):** Provides customizable select dropdowns for better user interaction and search functionalities.

- **Sass (`sass`):** A powerful CSS preprocessor that streamlines and organizes styling, contributing to the overall visual aesthetics of the application.
### Frontend:
- **React.js**: The core library used to build the dynamic and interactive user interface. React's component-based architecture allows for modular development and reusability.
- **Redux**: Used for state management, ensuring consistent data flow across the application and providing a single source of truth for managing complex UI states.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework that provides pre-built, customizable components, helping create a modern and responsive design with minimal effort.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used to handle API requests, enabling smooth communication with external APIs to fetch movie-related data.

### External API:
- **The Movie Database (TMDb) API**: Integrated to retrieve movie information such as details, reviews, and ratings, enhancing the app with real-time, up-to-date movie data.

### Hosting & Deployment:
- **Vercel/Netlify**: Deployed on Vercel or Netlify, offering continuous integration and seamless deployment from GitHub, ensuring the project is always accessible with fast load times and reliable hosting.

### Version Control:
- **Git/GitHub**: Git is used for version control, and GitHub hosts the project repository, enabling collaboration, issue tracking, and source code management.
